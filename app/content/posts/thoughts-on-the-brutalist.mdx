I saw The Brutalist last night in IMAX at the Metreon. I needed to see it there because of the VistaVision format - in use for the first time for an American feature in more than sixty years. The very tall and almost 1:1 aspect ratio fit the screen size pretty perfectly.

I learned afterwards, the choice was inspired by architectural photography. The large format allows the camera to be up tight by a building with a standard focal length, minimizing distortion while allowing for a wide field of view.

Itâ€™s hard not to compare this movie to There Will Be Blood - a movie I think of often (am I a psycho?). 

But in this case, the American Dream is not a capitalistic endeavor, but the opportunity to express oneself and create great feats of beauty.

Like There Will Be Blood though, it deals with the corruptive nature of the capitalistic system we find ourselves in. That to operate within it and to find success, we must wrestle with compromising ourselves and our ideals in the pursuit of something great. That the soulless machinations of our society can naturally come to corrupt *our* souls as well - no matter how idealistic our intentions may be.

The ultimate question feels impossible to answer. Should it all actually be about the destination and not the journey? If it all comes at great personal cost, but generations after you - are not only able to enjoy your works - but the fruits of your labor, is it worth it?
