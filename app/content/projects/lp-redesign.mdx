Liquidity is vital to any exchange market. A core innovation of the 
original Uniswap protocol was to democratize market-making by allowing 
anyone to provide liquidity and earn returns on their investment.

With the launch of the v4 Uniswap Protocol, we had 2 major goals for our web product:

1. Support new v4 functionality (e.g. Hooks and Custom Fee Tiers)
2. Undergo a comprehensive redesign to improve user understanding and accessibility to liquidity providers
