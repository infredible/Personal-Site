Liquidity is vital to any exchange market. A core innovation of the 
original Uniswap protocol was to democratize market-making by allowing 
anyone to provide liquidity and earn returns on their investment.

With the launch of the v4 Uniswap Protocol, we had 2 major goals for our web product:

1. Support new v4 functionality (e.g. [Hooks](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/concepts/hooks) and [Custom Fee Tiers](https://support.uniswap.org/hc/en-us/articles/20904283758349-What-are-fee-tiers))
2. Undergo a comprehensive redesign to improve user understanding and accessibility to liquidity providers
